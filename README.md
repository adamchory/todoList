# todoList
This webpage serves as an interactive to do list that includes a few defaulted to do's that need to get done each day. Clicking on the task will make it disappear, while I can also add any to do's that I hadn't pre-loaded.

## How to Run?
Click on any task that has been completed and it'll disappear. Add any to do item and press enter and it'll be added to the list. 

## Roadmap of Future Impovements
An awesome improvement to this exercise would be to cross out the tasks once they're completed rather than them disappearing. This would show the accomplishments for the day. Including more color and character through the styles.css file will allow for a more unique environment that is more special to me.
Another improvement would be coloring/bolding tasks that absolutely need to get done that day, while graying and italicizing those that are of lower priority.
